# HArDCore

HArDCore (Hybrid Arbitrary Degree::Core) is a set of two projects providing a C++ library to implement 2D and 3D schemes, on general polytopal meshes, with main unknowns being polynomials in the mesh elements and on the mesh faces.

This page is merely a landing page to redirect you to the 2D or 3D codes:
